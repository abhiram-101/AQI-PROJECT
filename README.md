# AQI-PROJECT
The Air Quality Index (AQI) Prediction Project is a data-driven application designed to estimate real-time air pollution levels based on key environmental features such as PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, CO, SO₂, and O₃ concentrations. In this project, we employed Linear Regression, a fundamental supervised machine learning algorithm, to model the relationship between pollutant levels and the corresponding AQI values. Linear regression is effective for this task due to its simplicity, interpretability, and efficiency in identifying linear trends within environmental data. However, for more accurate and robust predictions, especially in cases involving non-linear interactions between pollutants, we could enhance the model by incorporating more advanced techniques such as Decision Tree Regression, Random Forests, or even Neural Networks. Additionally, integrating real-time sensor data, geolocation inputs, and weather conditions like humidity and wind speed could significantly improve the model's predictive power. The user interface, developed using Streamlit, enables users to input pollutant concentrations and instantly visualize AQI predictions through both numeric results and an intuitive analog-style gauge, creating an engaging and educational experience about environmental health and safety.
